# Dynamic CPU Scheduling Simulator
This project is a Dynamic CPU Scheduling Simulator built with Python and Streamlit. It demonstrates and compares the performance of three CPU scheduling algorithms: FCFS (First Come First Served), SJF (Shortest Job First), and Priority Scheduling. The simulator allows users to input a list of processes with details like arrival time, burst time, and priority, and visualize the execution of each algorithm using a Gantt chart.


# Project Overview
This simulator helps analyze how different scheduling algorithms impact CPU performance metrics, such as:

   - Average Waiting Time
   - Turnaround Time
   - CPU Utilization

The interactive interface, built using Streamlit, also provides a comparative analysis report based on these metrics.


# Features
* Input Interface: Input process details including Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority.

* Algorithms Supported:
    - FCFS (First Come First Served)
    - SJF (Shortest Job First)
    - Priority Scheduling

* Gantt Chart Visualization: Visualize the scheduling order and execution time of each process.

* Comparative Analysis Report: Compare performance metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time for each algorithm.


# Technologies Used
- Programming Language:
    - Python: Core programming language for logic and implementation
- Libraries:
    - Streamlit: To build the interactive web application
    - Matplotlib: For creating Gantt charts
    - Pandas: For data handling and analysis



# Requirements:
   - pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib

* Additional Troubleshooting: Run Streamlit with Python explicitly: If the above steps don’t work, try running Streamlit by calling Python directly:
   - python -m streamlit run DCSS.py
